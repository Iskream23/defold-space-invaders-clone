# Turtle invaded - A Space Invaders clone

Turtle invaded is a space invaders clone made with defold game engine. The objective is to destroy enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen. The game features increasing levels of difficulty and rewards players with points for each enemy defeated. I used the Defold game engine to make Turtle invaded, thank you  SparklinLabs for the assets. You can play the game here: https://iskream23.itch.io/turtle-invaded

## Installation and usage

Just download the Defold game engine and open the game.project file. You'll need to install Rendercam (https://github.com/rgrams/rendercam) in your project by adding it as a library dependency.
